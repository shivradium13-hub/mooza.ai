# MOOZA AI — API image
#
# Builds `apps/api` (NestJS on Fastify) and the twelve workspace packages it
# depends on, from a pnpm monorepo.
#
# Build from the REPOSITORY ROOT, not from apps/api:
#   docker build -t moka-api .
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# DECISIONS WORTH KNOWING BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE
#
# DEBIAN, NOT ALPINE. There are no native dependencies — Argon2 comes from
# `hash-wasm`, and `pg` and `undici` are pure JavaScript — so Alpine would
# build. It is still not used, because the SSRF guard supplies undici a custom
# DNS `lookup` and resolves every address before connecting. musl and glibc do
# not resolve identically, and the difference would land in a security control
# rather than in a warning. A ~90 MB size saving is not worth introducing an
# untested variable there.
#
# THREE STAGES. Build tooling (typescript, tsup, esbuild, vitest) never reaches
# the final image: the runtime stage installs `--prod` from the same lockfile
# and receives only compiled `dist` output.
#
# NON-ROOT. The process cannot write to its own code, so a bug that reaches the
# filesystem cannot rewrite the application. The storage volume is chowned
# explicitly, since it is the one path that must be writable.
#
# NO MIGRATIONS AT STARTUP. Deliberate — see the note above CMD.
#
# PLAIN DOCKERFILE SYNTAX ONLY. This file once opened with a
# `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7` directive and cached the pnpm store with
# `RUN --mount=type=cache`. Both need BuildKit, and a builder that does not
# provide it rejects the file while parsing — before any step runs, so the
# failure arrives in about two seconds with nothing useful in the log. The
# cache mount only saved download time on rebuilds; correctness never depended
# on it. Keep this file parseable by a plain Docker daemon.

# turning a recoverable outage into a reconnect storm against a database that
# is already struggling.

# --- Start.
#
# TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING HERE.
#
# 1. `API_PORT=${PORT:-4000}`. Railway assigns a port through `PORT`; this
#    application reads `API_PORT`, validated by the config schema. Mapping it
#    here rather than editing the schema keeps the application unchanged and
#    platform-agnostic — nothing in the codebase learns what Railway is.
#
# 2. `exec`. Without it, the shell stays PID 1 and swallows SIGTERM, so the
#    graceful-shutdown handlers in main.ts — which close the server and drain
#    the connection pool — would never run, and the platform would eventually
#    SIGKILL mid-request. With `exec`, node becomes PID 1 and receives the
#    signal directly.
#
# MIGRATIONS ARE NOT RUN HERE, ON PURPOSE. Putting `db:migrate` in the start
# command means every replica races to migrate on every deploy, and one failure
# crash-loops the service. Migrations are an operator action against a database,
# not a side effect of a container starting. See docs/deployment.md §2.
