# MOOZA AI — Database Design

> **Status:** Phase 0 (design). No migrations written yet.
> Engine: **PostgreSQL 17.11** (already installed and running locally on :5432).
> ORM / migrations: **Drizzle ORM** + drizzle-kit.
> Required extension not yet present: **`vector` (pgvector)** — see `docs/roadmap.md`.

## 1. Conventions

| Convention | Rule |
|---|---|
| Primary keys | `uuid` (v7 where ordering helps insert locality) |
| Timestamps | `timestamptz`, always UTC. `created_at`, `updated_at` on every table |
| Soft delete | `deleted_at timestamptz NULL` on user-visible content only. Never on audit or usage tables |
| Tenant column | `organization_id uuid NOT NULL` on **every** tenant-owned table — no exceptions, no nullable variants |
| Naming | `snake_case`, plural table names |
| Money | `numeric(18,6)` for cost. **Never floating point** |
| Enums | Postgres native enums for closed sets; text + check constraint where the set will grow |
| JSON | `jsonb`, always with a Zod schema at the application boundary |

**Every tenant table gets RLS** (policy defined in `docs/security.md` §2.2) and this index as its first index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON <table> (organization_id, created_at DESC);
```

Foreign keys to tenant tables use `ON DELETE CASCADE` only where the child is genuinely owned by the parent. Audit, usage and approval records use `ON DELETE RESTRICT` — history must not vanish when its subject is deleted.

---

## 2. Extensions required

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";   -- present
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";    -- present
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_trgm";     -- present, fuzzy search
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "unaccent";    -- present, FTS normalisation
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "citext";      -- present, case-insensitive email
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "vector";      -- ** MISSING — Phase 2 blocker **
```

---

## 3. Identity and tenancy

```
users ──< organization_members >── organizations
                                        │
                                        └──< projects
```

**`users`** — `id`, `email citext UNIQUE`, `email_verified_at`, `password_hash` (Argon2id), `name`, `avatar_url`, `mfa_secret_encrypted`, `last_login_at`, timestamps.
*Not tenant-scoped* — a user can belong to several organizations.

**`organizations`** — `id`, `name`, `slug UNIQUE`, `plan_id`, `dek_wrapped bytea NOT NULL` (per-org data encryption key, see security §3.1), `settings jsonb`, `status`, timestamps. **This is the tenant root.**

**`organization_members`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `user_id`, `role_id`, `invited_by`, `joined_at`, `status`. `UNIQUE (organization_id, user_id)`.

**`roles`** — `id`, `organization_id NULL` (null = system role), `name`, `is_system bool`. **`permissions`** — `id`, `key`, `description`. **`role_permissions`** — join table.

**`projects`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `name`, `slug`, `description`, `settings jsonb`, timestamps. `UNIQUE (organization_id, slug)`.

**`sessions`** — `id`, `user_id`, `token_hash`, `active_organization_id`, `ip`, `user_agent`, `expires_at`. Server-side, revocable.

---

## 4. AI gateway

**`providers`** — `id`, `key` (`openai` | `anthropic` | `google` | `custom`), `name`, `base_url`, `status`. Global, not tenant-scoped.

**`models`** — `id`, `provider_id`, `model_key`, `display_name`, `capabilities text[]` (`coding`, `reasoning`, `vision`, `long_context`, `fast`, `cheap`), `context_window`, `max_output_tokens`, `input_cost_per_1m numeric(18,6)`, `output_cost_per_1m numeric(18,6)`, `supports_streaming`, `supports_tools`, `status`. Global registry; the router reads capabilities from here rather than hard-coding model names.

**`credentials`** — the Mooza Credentials vault.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `organization_id` | tenant-scoped, RLS |
| `provider_id` | which provider |
| `name` | user-facing label |
| `type` | `moka_managed` \| `byok` |
| `ciphertext bytea NOT NULL` | AES-256-GCM. **Excluded from every default select** |
| `iv bytea`, `auth_tag bytea` | per-record |
| `fingerprint text` | non-reversible, for display and dedupe |
| `last_four text` | display only |
| `status` | `active` \| `disabled` \| `revoked` |
| `last_tested_at`, `last_test_result` | outcome only, never the response body |
| `expires_at`, `rotated_at`, `created_by` | lifecycle |

AAD binds ciphertext to `(organization_id, id, provider_id)` so a row cannot be moved between organizations or credentials.

---

## 5. Conversations — IMPLEMENTED as workspace chat (0017)

Shipped as **`workspace_threads`** and **`workspace_thread_messages`** rather
than `conversations` / `messages`. The rename is not cosmetic: `chat_messages`
already exists (§9) and holds an anonymous visitor's transcript, and two tables
called "messages" in one schema get confused at a call site eventually. The one
that gets confused is the one facing the open internet.

**`workspace_threads`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `user_id`, `project_id NULL`,
`title`, `model_id NULL`, `message_count`, `created_at`, `last_message_at`.

**`workspace_thread_messages`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `thread_id`,
`role` (`user`|`assistant`), `content`, `model_id NULL`, `input_tokens`,
`output_tokens`, `error_code NULL`, `created_at`.

Indexes: `(organization_id, user_id, last_message_at DESC)` for the thread list,
`(organization_id, thread_id, created_at)` for the transcript.

### What the §36 shape has that this does not, and why

- **`agent_id`, `content_blocks`, `role = 'tool'`** — the workspace assistant has
  no tools. It cannot retrieve, cite or call anything, and the system prompt
  says so. Columns for tool calls and citation blocks would be columns that are
  always null, quietly implying a capability the surface does not have.
- **`cost_usd`** — cost is written by the gateway to `usage_records`, once, for
  every call it makes. A second copy on the message is a number that can
  disagree with the ledger, and when they disagree there is no way to tell
  which one is wrong.
- **`parent_message_id`** — edit-and-regenerate branching. Not built, so not
  modelled; a nullable self-reference nothing writes is a schema making a
  promise the product has not kept.
- **A GIN FTS index on `content`** — searching your own chat history is §16 and
  is not built either. The index would be paid for on every insert to serve a
  query nothing issues.
- **`deleted_at`** — deleting a thread deletes it, and the messages go with it
  by cascade. Soft deletion is right for things other people depend on; a
  person's own chat thread is not one of them, and "deleted" meaning "hidden
  from you and still in our database" is not what the button appears to say.

### Whose thread it is

`user_id` is `NOT NULL` and every read and write in `WorkspaceChatService`
filters on it. Say precisely what that is: RLS gives **tenant** isolation, so no
organization can reach another's threads under any query. It does **not** give
per-user isolation, because `withTenant()` binds only the organization —
`current_user_id()` is deliberately NULL inside a tenant transaction (§0002),
and widening that would change the primitive the isolation tests rest on. So
per-user scoping is a query-layer property, written in one service for exactly
that reason.

---

## 6. Knowledge engine

This is the most consequential part of the schema.

```
knowledge_sources ──< knowledge_documents ──< knowledge_chunks ──< knowledge_embeddings
```

**`knowledge_sources`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `project_id NULL`, `type` (`UPLOAD`|`WEBSITE`|`TEXT`|`URL`|`BUSINESS_DATA`|`FAQ`|`PRODUCT_DATA`|`POLICY`, extensible), `name`, `config jsonb` (crawl depth, domain restrictions, schedule), `status` (`UPLOADED`|`PROCESSING`|`READY`|`FAILED`), `error_message`, `last_indexed_at`, timestamps.

The `type` column is text + check constraint rather than a native enum, so adding `NOTION`, `GOOGLE_DRIVE`, `GITHUB`, `SLACK` or `MCP` is a data change, not a migration that touches the RAG engine (§11).

**`knowledge_documents`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `source_id`, `external_id`, `title`, `url`, `mime_type`, `byte_size`, `checksum` (dedupe), `page_count`, `raw_storage_key` (object store), `extracted_text_key`, `status`, `error_message`, `metadata jsonb`, timestamps. `UNIQUE (source_id, checksum)`.

**`knowledge_chunks`** — text and metadata **only, no vector column**.

`id`, `organization_id`, `document_id`, `source_id`, `chunk_index`, `content text`, `content_tsv tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', content)) STORED`, `token_count`, `page NULL`, `section NULL`, `heading_path text[]`, `metadata jsonb`, timestamps.

Indexes: `(organization_id, document_id, chunk_index)`, GIN on `content_tsv`, GIN trigram on `content`.

**`knowledge_embeddings`** — the deliberate separation.

```sql
id                  uuid PK
organization_id     uuid NOT NULL
chunk_id            uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES knowledge_chunks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
embedding_model_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES embedding_models(id)
embedding           vector(1024) NOT NULL
created_at          timestamptz
UNIQUE (chunk_id, embedding_model_id)
```

**Why a separate table.** Putting the vector on the chunk row hard-codes one model and one dimension into the schema. Changing embedding model would then be a destructive migration with downtime and no rollback. With this design two models coexist during a re-embed, retrieval selects by `embedding_model_id`, and cutover is a config flip. Re-embedding becomes a background job.

**`embedding_models`** — `id`, `provider_id NULL` (null = local ONNX), `model_key`, `dimensions int`, `max_input_tokens`, `cost_per_1m numeric(18,6)`, `is_default`, `status`. A check constraint enforces `dimensions <= 2000`, the HNSW limit.

Vector index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON knowledge_embeddings
  USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

> **Dimension note.** `vector(n)` is fixed per column. Supporting models of differing dimensions means either one nullable column per supported dimension, or a partitioned table per dimension. Recommendation: **partition `knowledge_embeddings` by `embedding_model_id`**, so each partition holds one dimension and one HNSW index. Decided concretely at the start of Phase 2.

**Hybrid retrieval** runs dense (HNSW cosine) and sparse (FTS on `content_tsv`) branches, both filtered by `organization_id`, and fuses them with Reciprocal Rank Fusion in SQL. No paid vector database.

---

## 7. Memory (§15)

**`memories`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `scope` (`conversation`|`project`|`agent`|`user`), `scope_id`, `user_id NULL`, `agent_id NULL`, `kind` (`fact`|`preference`|`summary`), `content text`, `embedding_id NULL`, `source_message_id NULL`, `confidence numeric`, `expires_at NULL`, `disabled_at NULL`, timestamps.

Kept deliberately separate from knowledge: different lifecycle, different retention, user-deletable, and never auto-populated with anything matching a secret pattern.

---

## 8. Agents and tools

**`agents`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `project_id NULL`, `name`, `description`, `instructions text`, `model_policy jsonb` (required capabilities, preferred model, fallbacks), `memory_policy jsonb`, `limits jsonb` (max steps, max tool calls, max tokens, timeout), `budget_usd numeric(18,6)`, `approval_policy jsonb`, `template_key NULL`, `version int`, `status`, timestamps.

**`agent_tools`** — `agent_id`, `tool_id`, `permission_level` (`READ`|`DRAFT`|`EXECUTE`), `config jsonb`. The allowlist, read fresh from the database on every run.

**`agent_knowledge`** — `agent_id`, `source_id`. Scopes retrieval.

**`agent_permissions`** — explicit grants beyond tool level.

**`tools`** — `id`, `organization_id NULL` (null = built-in), `key`, `name`, `description`, `input_schema jsonb`, `output_schema jsonb`, `default_permission_level`, `risk_level` (`low`|`medium`|`high`), `requires_approval bool`, `tenant_scoped bool`, `audit_required bool`, `handler_key`, `status`.

**`agent_executions`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `agent_id`, `conversation_id NULL`, `trigger` (`chat`|`api`|`automation`|`agent`), `status` (`running`|`awaiting_approval`|`succeeded`|`failed`|`cancelled`|`budget_exceeded`), `step_count`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cost_usd`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `error_code`.

**`tool_executions`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `agent_execution_id`, `tool_id`, `step_index`, `input jsonb` (validated, redacted), `output jsonb` (validated, redacted), `permission_level`, `approval_id NULL`, `status`, `duration_ms`, `error_code`, `created_at`.

**`approvals`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `agent_execution_id`, `tool_execution_id NULL`, `action`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`, `old_value jsonb`, `new_value jsonb`, `reason text`, `status` (`pending`|`approved`|`rejected`|`expired`), `decided_by NULL`, `decided_at NULL`, `expires_at`.

---

## 9. Chatbots (§22) — IMPLEMENTED (0007–0010)

Five tables, all RLS-protected. They are the first tables in the schema reachable by someone who is not a user of the platform at all, and three properties follow from that.

**`chatbots`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `project_id NULL`, `name`, `description`, `instructions`, `greeting`, `model_id`, `require_grounding bool DEFAULT true`, `min_passages`, `max_passages`, `handoff_enabled`, `retention_days`, `status` (`draft`|`active`|`disabled`), timestamps, `deleted_at`.

Defaults to `draft`: a chatbot is not live until someone publishes it. `instructions` is operator-authored and trusted like an agent's — but it is effectively **published**, since a determined visitor can persuade a model to recite its own system prompt and no instruction reliably prevents that. The builder UI says so in those words.

**`chatbot_sources`** — `chatbot_id`, `source_id`, `attached_by`.

The **publication boundary**, not a filter. Anything in an attached source can be quoted verbatim to any visitor; anything not attached is unreachable however the conversation goes. Empty means the bot retrieves nothing, which with grounding on means it answers nothing — the correct default for a surface whose failure mode is publishing internal documents to the internet.

**`chatbot_deployments`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `chatbot_id`, `name`, `public_key text UNIQUE`, `allowed_origins text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`, `messages_per_minute`, `conversations_per_hour`, `status` (`active`|`revoked`), `revoked_at`.

`public_key` is a public identifier, not a credential. It is pasted into the customer's HTML and readable by every visitor, so it is stored in plaintext and returned in full by the API — treating it as a secret would be theatre. It grants exactly what any visitor already has: a fresh, empty conversation with a bot that was published on purpose.

`allowed_origins` empty means embeddable **nowhere**, which is the correct failure direction for a list that controls publication.

This is the **one table with a narrow public read path**. A visitor arrives holding only a key, so the organization cannot be bound until it is looked up — the same shape as `0002_user_scope.sql`, and answered the same way:

```sql
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON chatbot_deployments
  USING (
    organization_id = current_org_id()
    OR (current_org_id() IS NULL
        AND public_key = current_deployment_key()
        AND status = 'active' AND revoked_at IS NULL)
  )
  WITH CHECK (organization_id = current_org_id());
```

`current_org_id() IS NULL` is what stops it widening tenant queries; `WITH CHECK` is untouched, so the public path reads one row and writes nothing; and `status = 'active'` inside the policy makes revocation effective immediately rather than eventually.

**`chat_conversations`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `chatbot_id`, `deployment_id`, `visitor_token_hash UNIQUE`, `origin`, `status` (`open`|`awaiting_human`|`with_human`|`closed`), `message_count`, handoff fields, `expires_at`, `closed_at`.

`visitor_token_hash` **is** a secret, unlike the public key, and is hashed like a session token. `origin` is the only provenance kept: no IP, no fingerprint, nothing that follows a person between visits. Staff need to tell two live conversations apart, not identify people, so the inbox shows a per-conversation pseudonym derived from the conversation id alone.

**`chat_messages`** — `conversation_id`, `role` (`visitor`|`assistant`|`human`|`notice`), `content`, `citations jsonb`, `error_code`, token counts, `author_user_id` (staff replies only).

`citations` records what the assistant was **shown**, derived from retrieval — not the model's account of its own sources, which is plausible rather than true.

Grants are `SELECT, INSERT, DELETE` — **no `UPDATE`**. The two are different properties: what was said to a member of the public in the organization's name cannot be rewritten, but a stranger's transcript can be erased, because retention has to be able to destroy it.

### Composite foreign keys (0010)

Every parent reference in these tables carries `organization_id`:

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (organization_id, source_id) REFERENCES knowledge_sources (organization_id, id)
```

PostgreSQL performs referential integrity checks **with row security disabled**, so a single-column `REFERENCES parent(id)` is satisfied by any row in the installation — visible or not — and an RLS policy that only checks the child row's `organization_id` will store a cross-tenant pointer without complaint. Security suite 8 found exactly that. Carrying the tenant into the key makes same-tenancy a referential constraint rather than a policy, which holds in the one place policies do not apply. See `docs/security.md` §4.5.

---

## 9b. Research runs (§8, §9) — IMPLEMENTED (0011)

**`research_runs`** — `question`, `status`, `answer`, `raw_answer`, `search_provider`, `verification jsonb`, token counts.

`raw_answer` is kept alongside the verified one deliberately. If the system silently corrected an answer, the person relying on it should be able to see what was corrected — storing only the tidied text would hide our own edits from the only people who would want to review them. `verification` records invalid markers, invented URLs and unverified quotes per run, so a *pattern* is visible: one fabricated URL is noise, the same prompt producing them every time is a fact worth being able to find.

**`research_sources`** — the persisted citation ledger. `ordinal` (the citation number), `requested_url`, `final_url` (after redirects), `title`, `content_hash`, **`excerpt`**, `outcome`, `detail`, `fetched_at`.

The excerpt is what makes the phase's gate checkable rather than merely asserted. "No fabricated citations" is a claim about a system; with the excerpt stored, anyone can open a six-month-old answer and see precisely what the model had in front of it when it wrote a sentence.

Candidates that were **not** collected are stored too, with the reason, and get `ordinal = NULL` — a hole in the numbering would be a citation that resolves to nothing while looking valid. A `CHECK` constraint enforces that a `collected` row carries all four of ordinal, final URL, hash and timestamp, because a row missing any of them is a citation nobody can check.

No `UPDATE` grant: a source record is what was fetched at a point in time, and a fetched page's hash is not something the application should be able to revise afterwards. `DELETE` is granted so a run can be removed with its evidence.

Composite foreign keys throughout, for the reason established in 0010.

---

## 10. Billing, entitlements, usage (§34, §35) — IMPLEMENTED (0012–0013)

Three layers, so no limit is ever written in application code:

```
plans ──< plan_entitlements
              │
organizations ─┴─< subscriptions ──< entitlement_overrides
                                          │
                                     usage / counts ──▶ enforcement
```

**`plans`** and **`plan_entitlements`** are **GLOBAL**, like `roles` and `permissions`: one catalogue for the installation. Both are registered in `INTENTIONALLY_GLOBAL_TABLES` so the isolation suite reviews that decision rather than skipping it.

**The grant is the important part:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON plans, plan_entitlements, entitlement_overrides TO moka_app;
```

The application reads the catalogue it is checked against and cannot write it. A bug able to `UPDATE plan_entitlements` would not be a limit bypass in one place — it would be every limit at once, silently, with the enforcement code still passing its own tests. Six tests in security suite 11 assert this from the runtime role.

**`plan_entitlements`** — `plan_id`, `feature_key`, `limit_value bigint NULL`, `allowed_values text[]`, `unit`. `limit_value` has three states: a number, `NULL` for **unlimited**, and an absent row for **not included**. `limit ?? 0` breaks every unlimited customer; `limit ?? Infinity` gives the product away when a plan is unseeded. The application models all three explicitly.

**`subscriptions`** — one row per organization, enforced by a unique index. Two would make "which plan am I on?" a question with two answers, and enforcement would pick arbitrarily. `plan_id` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`: deleting a plan organizations are on should fail loudly rather than silently unsubscribing them. `external_ref` is null for every subscription this build creates, because no processor is integrated.

**`entitlement_overrides`** — a negotiated exception without cloning a plan per customer, which produces a plan table nobody can reason about. `reason` is `NOT NULL` and non-empty: an unexplained override is indistinguishable from a mistake six months later, and this is where "why does this customer have 10× the limit?" must be answerable.

**`credits`** — the **cache**. `balance_micro_usd` is a copy of the ledger's sum, because a pre-flight check on every provider call cannot sum a million rows. Deliberately **not** constrained non-negative: cost is unknown until a call returns, so concurrent calls can each pass the pre-check before any debits, and clamping at zero would hide that overspend rather than record it.

**`credit_transactions`** — the authoritative ledger. Append-only (`SELECT`, `INSERT`; no `UPDATE`, no `DELETE`). Integer micro-dollars, never floats.

Three constraints carry real weight:

- **`credit_transactions_sign_matches_kind`** — a `debit` of +500 would silently add credit *and reconcile perfectly against a wrong balance*. Obvious in review, invisible in production, so it is a constraint rather than a convention.
- **`credit_transactions_adjustment_explained`** — an adjustment is a human overriding the ledger and must say why.
- **`credit_transactions_unpriced_is_zero`** — a call we could not price is recorded as a zero-amount debit flagged `unpriced`. `0013` relaxed the sign rule in exactly one direction to admit it: a debit may be zero **if and only if** it is unpriced. Charging a guess invents a figure people budget against; recording nothing makes the unpriced model free and unlimited.

**`usage_records`** (from 0004) is unchanged and already carries `cost_micro_usd bigint NULL`, where NULL means *pricing unknown*, not free. The usage page reports the known-cost total and the unpriced count **separately** — `COALESCE(cost, 0)` would produce one confident figure that silently understates the bill.

**Still not partitioned.** `docs/architecture.md` called for range-partitioning `usage_records` by month from the start, and it is not done. That is a Phase 10 performance item, recorded here rather than quietly dropped.

---

## 11. API, MCP, automation

**`api_keys`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `name`, `key_hash` (Argon2id), `prefix` (display), `scopes text[]`, `rate_limit_per_min`, `last_used_at`, `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, `created_by`.

**`mcp_servers`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `name`, `transport`, `endpoint`, `credential_id NULL`, `status`, `last_discovered_at`.
**`mcp_tools`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `mcp_server_id`, `tool_key`, `input_schema jsonb`, `permission_level`, `risk_level`, `enabled`. MCP tools are mirrored into the same permission model as native tools; they get no shortcut around the gate.

**`automations`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `project_id NULL`, `name`, `trigger_type` (`schedule`|`event`|`webhook`|`manual`), `schedule_cron NULL`, `timezone`, `action jsonb`, `agent_id NULL`, `permissions jsonb`, `retry_policy jsonb`, `owner_user_id`, `status`, `next_run_at`.
**`automation_runs`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `automation_id`, `status`, `attempt`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `output jsonb`, `error_code`.

---

## 12. Audit

**`audit_logs`** — `id`, `organization_id`, `actor_type` (`user`|`api_key`|`agent`|`system`), `actor_id`, `action`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`, `before jsonb`, `after jsonb`, `request_id`, `ip`, `user_agent`, `outcome`, `created_at`.

Append-only: the `moka_app` role holds `INSERT` and `SELECT` grants but **no `UPDATE` or `DELETE`**. Month-partitioned. No soft delete, no cascade — audit history survives deletion of its subject.

---

## 13. Migration safety (§46)

1. Inspect the current schema before generating anything.
2. Generate with drizzle-kit; **review the SQL by hand** — never apply blind.
3. Every migration is checked for destructive operations (`DROP`, `ALTER ... TYPE`, `NOT NULL` on populated columns).
4. Destructive changes require the expand/contract pattern: add, backfill, switch reads, then drop in a later release.
5. Migrations run under a role distinct from the application role.
6. No migration runs against production without a verified backup and a written rollback plan.
7. RLS policies are created **in the same migration** as the table they protect, never in a follow-up — a table must never exist unprotected.

---

## 14. Table inventory

Against the §36 list, with deviations noted:

`users`, `organizations`, `organization_members`, `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`*, `sessions`*, `projects`, `conversations`, `messages`, `providers`, `models`, `credentials`, `agents`, `agent_tools`, `agent_permissions`, `agent_knowledge`*, `agent_executions`*, `tools`, `tool_executions`, `knowledge_sources`, `knowledge_documents`, `knowledge_chunks`, `knowledge_embeddings`*, `embedding_models`*, `memories`, `chatbots`, `chatbot_deployments`, `subscriptions`, `plans`, `plan_entitlements`*, `entitlement_overrides`*, `usage_records`, `credits`, `credit_transactions`*, `chatbot_sources`*, `chat_conversations`*, `chat_messages`*, `workspace_threads`*, `workspace_thread_messages`*, `research_runs`*, `research_sources`*, `api_keys`, `mcp_servers`, `mcp_tools`, `automations`, `automation_runs`, `approvals`, `audit_logs`

`*` = added beyond the §36 list, each for a stated reason:

- **`knowledge_embeddings` + `embedding_models`** — avoids hard-coding one embedding model into the schema (§6).
- **`agent_executions`** — `tool_executions` needs a parent run to attach to; without it there is nowhere to record budgets, step counts or run status.
- **`plan_entitlements` / `entitlement_overrides`** — §34 explicitly requires `Plan → Entitlement → Usage → Enforcement` and forbids hard-coded limits. A flat `entitlements` table cannot express both plan defaults and per-organization exceptions.
- **`credit_transactions`** — the §36 list has `credits` (a balance) but no ledger. A balance with no ledger is a number nobody can explain to a customer disputing it, so the balance became a cache and the ledger became the record.
- **`chatbot_sources`** — the publication boundary between a chatbot and the knowledge it may quote. §36 assumed one implicit scope; making it an explicit join is what lets an organization decide, per chatbot, which internal documents become readable by the public.
- **`chat_conversations` / `chat_messages`** — the §36 list has `conversations` and `messages` for STAFF chat. A visitor conversation is a different thing with a different principal, a different retention policy and a different token, and merging them would put an anonymous stranger's transcript in the same table as a member's.
- **`workspace_threads` / `workspace_thread_messages`** — the §36 `conversations` and `messages`, renamed. `chat_messages` was already taken by the visitor transcript, and a schema with two "messages" tables invites the one mistake nobody can afford: reading or writing a stranger's conversation where a member's was meant. See §5 for the columns deliberately left out.
- **`research_runs` / `research_sources`** — §36 has no table for web research, and the citation ledger cannot live in `agent_executions`: a research run happens with or without an agent, and the evidence has to outlive the conversation that prompted it to be auditable at all.
- **`role_permissions`, `sessions`, `agent_knowledge`, `credit_transactions`** — required join tables and ledgers, not redundant entities.

No table in the §36 list has been dropped.
