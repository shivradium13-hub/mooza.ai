# Deployment

How to get MOKA AI running, and — more importantly — **which piece goes where**.

---

## 1. The short version

MOKA AI is two deployable units with different shapes, and they do not belong on the same kind of host.

| Unit | What it is | Vercel? |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/web` | Next.js 15. Pure API client: no database access, no server routes, one workspace dependency. | **Yes.** This is exactly what Vercel is for. |
| `apps/api` | NestJS on Fastify. Long-running process, connection pool, local disk, in-request agent loops. | **No.** Three things break silently — see the note in §2. Railway instead: §3. |

So: **web on Vercel, API on a container host, PostgreSQL managed.**

That is not a limitation of Vercel. It is what the API currently is — a stateful server that writes to disk and holds a pool. Putting it on a serverless platform would produce something that boots, serves traffic, passes a smoke test, and quietly loses every uploaded file.

### 2.1 What you need first

The web app is a **client**. It is useless without an API to talk to, and the API's address is baked in at build time (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is inlined into the bundle, not read at runtime). So deploy the API first, or expect to redeploy the web app once you have its URL.

### 2.2 Import the repository

Push the repo somewhere Vercel can read, then import the project at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).

**Set Root Directory to `apps/web`.** Project Settings → Build & Deployment → Root Directory. This is not a preference, it is a requirement, and leaving it unset is the most likely reason a first deploy fails:

```
Warning: Could not identify Next.js version, ensure it is defined as a project dependency.
Error: No Next.js version detected. Make sure your package.json has "next" in either
"dependencies" or "devDependencies".
```

That message sends you to look at `package.json`, which is the wrong place — the root `package.json` is a workspace manifest and correctly has no `next`. The app is in `apps/web`, and Vercel was never told to look there.

There is no way to fix this from a root `vercel.json`. Vercel's Next.js builder resolves `next` from the Root Directory's `package.json` **before** any `buildCommand` runs, so a root config declaring `"framework": "nextjs"` fails during detection. Dropping `framework` avoids that error but produces something worse: a build with no Next.js builder, which deploys the static pages and silently breaks `/`, the one route that is server-rendered.

So the root `vercel.json` deliberately fails on the first line with an explanation, rather than pretending to be a fallback. A build that stops and names the setting beats one that succeeds into a half-broken site.

**If the build fails on the install step**, it is almost certainly the pnpm version (§2.3). Set `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=1` in the project's environment variables: that makes Vercel honour `packageManager` through corepack instead of its own bundled pnpm.

**Do not create a second Vercel project for the API.** It cannot run there — §2 and §3 say why — and a failed `api-*.vercel.app` project is a symptom of that, not a configuration problem to solve.

With Root Directory set, Vercel reads `apps/web/vercel.json`:

```json
"installCommand": "cd ../.. && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile",
"buildCommand":   "cd ../.. && npx turbo run build --filter=@moka/web..."
```

The `...` suffix is not decoration — it tells Turborepo to build `@moka/web` **and its dependencies**. `@moka/core` resolves to `dist/`, so a build that skipped it would fail on a missing module. Verified from a clean tree: 11 tasks, ~39s cold.

### 2.3 One thing to check before the first build

The repo pins `"packageManager": "pnpm@12.3.4"` and `"engines": { "node": ">=20.11.0" }`. Vercel reads `packageManager` and provisions that pnpm through corepack.

If the build image does not yet offer pnpm 12, the install step fails immediately and loudly — which is the good kind of failure, but it will be your first one. Either select a newer Node version in **Project Settings → General → Node.js Version**, or pin `packageManager` to a pnpm major the image supports and re-run `pnpm install` locally so the lockfile matches. Do not delete the field: without it Vercel guesses, and a guessed package manager against a `pnpm-lock.yaml` is how a build resolves different dependency versions than the ones that were tested.

### 2.4 Environment variables

Only one is required:

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://api.yourdomain.com` | The deployed API's origin. No trailing slash. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://yourdomain.com` | Optional. Canonical origin for `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and Open Graph tags. No trailing slash. |

**Set them before the first build.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are inlined at build time, so changing one later needs a redeploy, not a restart.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is optional because `lib/site.ts` falls back to Vercel's `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`, so a first deploy emits correct absolute urls with nothing configured rather than advertising `localhost` to a crawler. Set it explicitly once a custom domain is attached: it is the one value a domain change does not invalidate. The fallback deliberately uses the *production* url and not `VERCEL_URL`, which is per-deployment — canonicals built from that would point at a preview that stops existing.

### 2.4a There is deliberately no `ignoreCommand`

`apps/web/vercel.json` once carried one, to skip rebuilds when nothing the web app depends on had changed:

```
git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD -- ../../apps/web ../../packages ../../pnpm-lock.yaml ../../turbo.json
```

It cost this project its first production deploy. The root `vercel.json` is not on that path list, so a commit touching only root config produced no diff, the command exited 0, and Vercel skipped the build — which it reports as **CANCELED**, indistinguishable at a glance from a failure.

Two further faults in the same line: `HEAD^` is not the previously deployed commit, so a push of several commits only ever examined the last one; and a first deploy has nothing to compare against.

`turbo-ignore` gets all of this right because it reads the dependency graph, but it is deprecated in favour of `turbo query affected`. Until someone needs the optimisation enough to do it properly, every push builds. It is worth well under a minute here, and a deploy that silently does not happen costs far more.

Note also that `vercel.json` rejects unknown keys — including `_comment` style ones. Explanations go here, not in the file.

### 2.4b The public site

`/`, `/product`, `/pricing` and `/security` are the marketing site and are public. The first is server-rendered because it still routes a signed-in visitor to their dashboard; the other three prerender to static HTML and are served from the CDN.

`robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are generated from one route list in `apps/web/src/lib/site.ts`, so a page cannot appear in the sitemap while being disallowed from crawling. The application routes (`/dashboard`, `/login`, and the rest) are disallowed — they redirect anonymous requests anyway, so this is about not wasting crawl budget, not about access control.

### 2.5 The build refuses to publish secrets

`apps/web/next.config.mjs` runs `findLeakyPublicVars` — the same function that stops the API booting with a leaky variable — and **throws** if any `NEXT_PUBLIC_` name looks like a secret (`secret`, `password`, `token`, `api_key`, `private`, `credential`, `encryption`, `database_url`, `_dsn`).

This matters more on a hosting platform than it does locally. Environment variables get set in a dashboard by whoever has access, and anything `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is shipped to every visitor's browser. A `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` added in a hurry would be published to the internet by the next deploy.

It throws rather than warns, deliberately: a warning in build output is a line nobody reads; a failed deploy is a conversation.

```
Error: Refusing to build: these NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables look like secrets and
would be inlined into the browser bundle, where every visitor can read them:
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY.
```

### 2.6 After it deploys

Add the Vercel domain to the API's `CORS_ORIGINS`, or every authenticated request will fail at the browser. The app's routes authenticate by cookie, so CORS is doing real work there — it is what stops another site making authenticated requests with a user's session.

---

## 3. Deploying the API to Railway

`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` and `railway.json` are in the repository root and are already configured. Railway reads `railway.json` automatically, so there is nothing to fill in on the Build tab.

### 3.1 Create the service

1. [railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new) → **Deploy from GitHub repo** → pick `moka.ai`.
2. Leave the root directory as the repository root. **Do not set it to `apps/api`** — the Dockerfile builds the whole workspace and the pnpm lockfile lives at the root.
3. Railway detects `railway.json`, sees `"builder": "DOCKERFILE"`, and stops guessing.

### 3.2 Add a volume — before the first deploy

**Settings → Volumes → New Volume**, mount path exactly:

```
/data
```

Uploaded documents are written to disk. Without a volume they live in the container's writable layer and are destroyed on every redeploy — the upload returns `200` and the file is gone by the next deploy. The image creates `/data/storage` and chowns it to the non-root user, so an empty volume mounted there is writable immediately.

### 3.3 Environment variables — the complete list

Paste these into **Variables → Raw Editor**. Replace every `<...>`. Nothing here has a default that is safe to leave.

```
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=info

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://moka_app:<APP_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>/moka_ai?sslmode=require
DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL=postgresql://moka_migrator:<MIGRATOR_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>/moka_ai?sslmode=require
DATABASE_SSL=true
DATABASE_POOL_MAX=10

AUTH_SECRET=<32 random bytes, base64>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32 random bytes, base64>
SESSION_TTL_SECONDS=2592000

REDIS_URL=<redis:// or rediss:// URL>

STORAGE_DRIVER=local
STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH=/data/storage

CORS_ORIGINS=https://<your-project>.vercel.app
COOKIE_SAMESITE=none

API_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

> **`COOKIE_SAMESITE=none` is not optional for a `vercel.app` + `railway.app`
> deployment, and getting it wrong produces the most confusing failure in this
> whole document.**
>
> "Same site" means the same registrable domain. `myapp.vercel.app` and
> `myapi.up.railway.app` are *different* sites, so under the default `lax` the
> browser will not attach the session cookie to a single `fetch()`. Login
> returns `201` and sets the cookie, and then every request after it is a
> `401` — with nothing in any log explaining why, because from the server's
> point of view the request simply arrived without a cookie.
>
> `none` requires `Secure`, which is why config refuses it unless
> `NODE_ENV=production`.
>
> **The better fix, if you own a domain:** put the API on
> `api.yourdomain.com` and the app on `app.yourdomain.com`, set
> `COOKIE_DOMAIN=.yourdomain.com`, and leave `COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax`. Same site,
> so nothing is given up. `none` trades away the SameSite half of the CSRF
> defence; the Origin check on state-changing requests replaces it, but not
> needing the trade at all is better than replacing it.

### Generate and validate the block instead of typing it

Fifteen variables, several of which fail the deploy if they are subtly wrong,
is a poor thing to assemble by hand. This builds the whole block and checks it
against `loadConfig` — the same function `main.ts` calls at boot — so a block
that gets written is one that will get past configuration:

```bash
node infra/deploy/railway-env.mjs --db-host <host> --app-url https://<your-project>.vercel.app --redis-url <redis url>
```

It reads `AUTH_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `local/deploy-secrets.txt`
rather than minting them, so re-running it cannot silently rotate the
encryption key and make every stored credential unreadable. Output goes to
`local/railway-variables.txt`, which is gitignored because it contains that
key. Add `--same-site lax --cookie-domain .yourdomain.com` if you put both
services under one domain.

If it refuses, it names the reason and writes nothing — a plaintext origin, a
cookie domain no origin sits under, a localhost origin in production. Each of
those would otherwise be a failed remote deploy and a scroll through a build
log.

Generate the two secrets separately — they must not be the same value:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

**Do not set `PORT`.** Railway injects it, and the container maps it to `API_PORT` at startup. Setting it yourself will fight the platform.

**Do not set `API_PORT`.** Same reason — it is derived.

**Do not set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`.** Production refuses to boot with them, on purpose: an instance-wide key means every organization spends the operator's key, which makes per-tenant cost attribution, quotas and revocation fictional. Provider credentials belong to an organization, added through Moka Credentials.

What each one is for, and what happens if it is wrong:

| Variable | Required | If wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | yes | Anything but `production` skips every hardening check below |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Must be `moka_app`. A superuser here silently disables all tenant isolation — the process refuses to start |
| `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` | yes | Must differ from `DATABASE_URL`; the owner can turn RLS off |
| `DATABASE_SSL` | yes | `false` sends every row in the clear; boot refused |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | yes | Session signing key, ≥32 bytes base64 |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | yes | Exactly 32 bytes base64. **Lose it and every stored credential is unrecoverable** |
| `REDIS_URL` | yes | Boot refused without it — see the caveat in §3.6 |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | yes | No `localhost`, no `http://`. Wrong value = every logged-in request fails in the browser |
| `COOKIE_SAMESITE` | yes, for split domains | `none` when the app and API are on different registrable domains. `lax` (the default) sends no cookie at all across sites |
| `COOKIE_DOMAIN` | no | A shared parent (`.yourdomain.com`) when both sit under one domain. Refused at boot if no `CORS_ORIGINS` entry is under it |
| `API_HOST` | yes | Must not be `127.0.0.1`, or the service is unreachable |
| `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` | yes | Must be under the mounted volume, or uploads vanish |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | yes | `debug`/`trace` refused in production; verbose logs capture request content |
| `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` | no | Defaults to 10. Lower it if your database plan caps connections |
| `SEARXNG_URL` | no | Only if you self-host SearXNG for web search |
| `BILLING_MANUAL_PAYMENTS` | no | `true` lets an admin activate a paid plan against an off-system payment |

### 3.4 Run the migrations — from your machine, once

Migrations are deliberately **not** in the container start command. Every replica would race to migrate on each deploy, and one failure would crash-loop the service. A migration is an operator action against a database, not a side effect of a container booting.

```bash
DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL="postgresql://moka_migrator:<MIGRATOR_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>/moka_ai?sslmode=require" pnpm db:migrate
```

Then seed the roles, permissions and plan catalogue:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://moka_app:<APP_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>/moka_ai?sslmode=require" DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL="postgresql://moka_migrator:<MIGRATOR_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>/moka_ai?sslmode=require" pnpm db:seed
```

Run migrations **before** the first deploy finishes, or at least before anyone uses the service. The API starts fine against an unmigrated database — readiness reports `schema: "ok"` because a database with no tables has no unprotected ones — so an empty database will not stop a deploy going live.

### 3.5 Verify the deployment

Railway gates the deploy on `/health/ready` (set in `railway.json`), so a version that cannot reach its database never receives traffic — the previous one keeps serving. Once it is live:

```bash
curl https://<your-service>.up.railway.app/health/ready
```

```json
{"status":"ok","database":"ok","schema":"ok","rateLimiter":"shared"}
```

`schema` is the one to read carefully. Anything other than `ok` means an organization-scoped table is missing its row-level security — treat it as a data-exposure incident, not a health blip. `"unknown"` means the check could not run, which is not the same as passing.

Then run the drill against the live database:

```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://moka_app:<APP_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>/moka_ai?sslmode=require" TEST_DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL="postgresql://moka_migrator:<MIGRATOR_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>/moka_ai?sslmode=require" pnpm test:drill
```

It asserts that RLS is enabled **and forced** on every tenant table, that the grants making the ledgers append-only survived, and that the boot guard refuses a bypassing role.

Then check the thing the drill cannot see — that a real browser keeps its session. Log in to the deployed web app, reload the page, and confirm you are still logged in. If the reload bounces you to the login screen, `COOKIE_SAMESITE` is wrong; nothing else produces that symptom.

### 3.6 Do not raise the replica count

`railway.json` pins `"numReplicas": 1`. Two things break at two replicas, and both break quietly:

- **Rate limiting.** `REDIS_URL` is required by config, but the Redis driver is still a `TODO` — only `InMemoryRateLimiter` exists. On one instance that is "per-process" and honest. On two it is half the limit an operator thinks they set.
- **File storage.** The volume is attached to one instance. A second replica cannot see the first's uploads.

Scale vertically instead until both are addressed.

### 3.7 What the Dockerfile does, in one paragraph

Three stages on `node:22-bookworm-slim`. The build stage installs the full workspace with `--frozen-lockfile` and runs `turbo run build --filter=@moka/api...` — the trailing `...` includes the twelve workspace dependencies, each of which resolves through its own `dist`. The runtime stage reinstalls with `--prod` from the same lockfile and copies only compiled output, so typescript, tsup, esbuild and vitest never reach the image. It runs as the non-root `node` user, cannot write to its own code, and maps Railway's `PORT` to `API_PORT` in the start command so nothing in the application has to know what Railway is. Debian rather than Alpine is deliberate: the SSRF guard supplies undici a custom DNS lookup, and musl and glibc do not resolve identically — not a difference worth introducing into a security control to save 90 MB.

---

## 4. The database

PostgreSQL 16+, managed is fine (Neon, Supabase, RDS, or your own). What is **not** optional is the two-role model.

Run `infra/db/bootstrap.sql` as a superuser to create them:

| Role | Owns | Used by | Bypasses RLS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `moka_migrator` | every table | migrations only | no (`NOBYPASSRLS`) |
| `moka_app` | nothing | the running API | no (`NOBYPASSRLS`) |

**The application must connect as `moka_app`.** This is the single highest-consequence setting in the system: every tenant-isolation control reduces to "the connecting role is subject to row-level security". Point `DATABASE_URL` at a superuser and every policy stops applying at once — nothing errors, every request succeeds, and one customer is served another customer's data.

Managed providers hand you an owner-ish role by default (`neondb_owner`, `postgres`), and using it directly is the mistake this guard exists for:

```
Refusing to start: the application connects as "postgres", which is a superuser.
```

The process exits `1` and binds nothing. Fix the connection string; do not work around it.

### 4.1 Connection pooling

If you put a pooler in front (Neon's pooled endpoint, PgBouncer, Supabase's `:6543`), use **transaction mode**. Tenant binding uses `set_config('app.current_org_id', $1, true)` — the `true` makes it transaction-local, which is exactly what survives transaction-mode pooling. Session mode also works; statement mode does not.

### 4.2 Migrate and verify

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

```bash
pnpm test:drill
```

Run the drill against the deployed database, as the deployed roles. It asserts that RLS is enabled **and forced** on every tenant table, that the grants making the ledgers append-only survived, and that the boot guard refuses a bypassing role. A restore or a provider migration that quietly dropped ACLs is exactly what it catches.

---

## 5. Production configuration checklist

The API refuses to start in production unless all of these hold. Each is refused because the failure is silent, not because the rule is tidy — full reasoning in `docs/operations.md` §2.4.

| Setting | Required |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | connects as `moka_app`, not `postgres` |
| `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` | **different** from `DATABASE_URL` |
| `DATABASE_SSL` | `true` |
| `REDIS_URL` | set — but see §3.2, the driver is still a TODO |
| `API_HOST` | not `127.0.0.1` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | your Vercel domain, `https://` only, no `localhost` |
| `COOKIE_SAMESITE` | `none` for split domains; `lax` only if same registrable domain |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | not `debug` or `trace` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` etc. | **unset** — per-organization credentials only |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 32 random bytes, base64, backed up off the server |

Losing `ENCRYPTION_KEY` makes every stored provider credential unrecoverable. That is the design, not a bug. Do not store it beside the backups.

---

## 6. What will not work yet, wherever you deploy it

Stated plainly rather than discovered after launch (§45):

- **No AI does anything without a provider credential.** No live model call has ever been made by this codebase. Add a credential per organization through Moka Credentials; instance-wide keys are refused in production.
- **Retrieval is lexical, not semantic.** pgvector was unavailable during development. Isolation is enforced identically either way; quality is not.
- **File uploads need a persistent disk.** See §3.1.
- **Rate limiting is per-process.** See §3.2.
- **No sandbox**, so the Phase 8 coding agent and browser agent are absent. MCP and agent-to-agent delegation do ship.
- **Research runs against supplied URLs** unless you self-host SearXNG and set `SEARXNG_URL`.

---

## 7. A realistic first deployment

```bash
pnpm verify && pnpm test:security
```

The order is not arbitrary: the web build inlines the API's URL, and the API will not start without a database.

1. **Database** (§4). Provision Postgres, run `infra/db/bootstrap.sql` as a superuser to create `moka_app` and `moka_migrator`, then `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm db:seed` from your machine.
2. **API** (§3). Railway, repository root, add the `/data` volume *before* the first deploy, paste the variables from §3.3. Confirm `GET /health/ready` returns `"schema":"ok"`.
3. **Web** (§2). Vercel, Root Directory `apps/web`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` set to the Railway URL **before** the first build.
4. **CORS.** Put the real Vercel domain in the API's `CORS_ORIGINS` and redeploy. Until this is done every logged-in request fails in the browser.
5. **Verify.** `pnpm test:drill` against the live database, then create two organizations and confirm neither can see the other's data before letting anyone real near it.
