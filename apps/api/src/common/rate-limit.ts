 * people reach for otherwise is editing the limits at each call site — which
 * is the same weakening, spread across the code and easy to forget.
 *
 * WHAT IS GIVEN UP. Login is limited to blunt credential stuffing: an attacker
 * with a list of leaked passwords can otherwise try them against a known
 * address as fast as the network allows. Nothing else in the stack replaces
 * that. Do not set this on a deployment with real accounts.
