     * type — so the handler's own check is what a large file actually hits.
     *
     * The cost is that every route now accepts a body this size rather than

   * THE APP (everything not under /public/): an explicit origin allowlist with
   * credentials enabled. These routes authenticate by cookie, so CORS is doing
   * real work — it is what stops another site making authenticated requests
   * with the user's session. A wildcard is impossible by construction:
   * `credentials: true` plus `*` is rejected by browsers, and the list comes
   * from validated configuration.
   *
   * THE PUBLIC CHAT SURFACE (/public/): any origin, credentials OFF. This
   * looks alarming and is not, because of the second half: these endpoints
   * send and accept NO cookies. The visitor token travels in a header, so
   * there is no ambient authority for a cross-site request to ride on, and
   * CORS therefore protects nothing here — anyone can already call these
   * endpoints with curl. Reflecting the origin would give false comfort;
   * refusing it would only break the legitimate embeds, since a chatbot is
   * meant to be called from the customer's own site and we cannot know every
   * such site at boot.
   *
   * The control that actually decides which sites may use a deployment is the
   * per-deployment allowlist, enforced in the handler and — the strong half —
   * as `frame-ancestors` on the chat frame, which the visitor's own browser
   * enforces. See @moka/chat origin.ts.

   * split-domain deployment cannot use `lax` (see @moka/config), and switching
   * to `none` gives that protection up. Something has to replace it.
   *
   * CORS alone does not. CORS decides whether a caller may READ a response; it
   * does not stop the request executing. A "simple" cross-site request — a
   * form POST, a GET — is dispatched with credentials and runs on the server,
   * and only the response is withheld. For a state-changing route that is too
   * late: the write already happened.
   *
   * So every mutating request must carry an Origin this deployment allows.
   * Browsers set `Origin` on all cross-site requests and cannot be talked out
   * of it from script, which is what makes the check meaningful.
   *
   * Deliberately NOT applied to:
   *   - safe methods (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS), which change nothing;
   *   - `/public/`, the chatbot surface, which is called from customer sites we
   *     cannot enumerate and carries NO ambient authority — its visitor token
   *     travels in a header, so there is no cookie for a forged request to
   *     ride on;
   *   - requests with no Origin at all, which is curl, a mobile client or a
   *     server-to-server call. Those carry no browser cookie jar, so they are
   *     not the CSRF threat; rejecting them would break every non-browser
   *     caller to defend against something that cannot happen.
