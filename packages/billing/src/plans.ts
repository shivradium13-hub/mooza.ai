/**
 * The default plan catalogue (master prompt §34).
 *
 * THIS IS SEED DATA, NOT A HARD-CODED LIMIT, and the difference is the gate.
 *
 * These become rows in `plans` and `plan_entitlements` the first time the seed
 * runs. After that the database is authoritative: an operator changes what a
 * plan includes with an UPDATE, and nothing here is consulted again. No
 * enforcement path imports this file.
 *
 * A test asserts that — the only importers are the seed script and the tests
 * themselves. If an enforcement call site ever reaches for `FREE_PLAN.limits`
 * to answer a question, the limit has silently become hard-coded again and the
 * whole three-layer design is decoration.
 *
 * ON THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES: they are a plausible starting shape, not a
 * pricing decision. Nobody has done the unit economics, no market research
 * informs them, and the free tier's credit allowance in particular is a guess
 * at "enough to evaluate the product". Presenting them as considered would be
 * the kind of false precision this codebase avoids elsewhere.
